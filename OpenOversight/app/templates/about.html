<h1>About OpenOversight</h1>
<p>OpenOversight is an accountability platform for helping the public identify police officers for the purpose of filing complaints. We rely on crowdsourced and public data to build a database of police officers in a city, allowing the public to filter through the dataset to find the name and badge number of the offending officer.</p>
